This file contains the detailed explaination of the WOE_IV.py file, where in Weight of Evidence(WOE) and Information Value(IV) have been computed. We have used the Titanic dataset for our calculations. This is a method used to find the Information value of a particular feature.
The technique is applicable for binary class classification problem.

Steps involved in computation:-

1. Obtain the bins for the independent variable. For a categorical variable each unique category will act as a bin.
   Whereas in case of a continuous variable decide the number of bins(usually 10 or 20) that are required.
   We have used the in-built function "cut" of the Pandas library in Python in order to obtain the bins.

2. Obtain the percentage of positive class and negative class in each bin.

3. Calculate the WOE value for each bin. WOE = log(percentage_positives/percentage_negatives).

4. Calculate the IV value for each bin. IV = (percentage_positives - percentage_negatives)*WOE. Here the WOE is the value calculated above for the respective bin.

5. The Information Value for a variable is the sum of all the IV values obtained for each bin.

Deciding the imporatance of the variable basis the IV value.

Range of IV Value 			Importance

<0.02						Not Important
[0.02, 0.1]					Weak Predictive Power
[0.1, 0.3)					Medium Predictive Power
[0.3, 0.5]					Strong Predictive Power
>0.5						Suspecious Predictive Power


Note:- There can be a case where for a particular bin either the number of positives(referred to as Events) or the number of negatives(referred to as non-events) can be 0. In such cases the WOE cannot be calculated due to log function being undefined.
A possible solution 
goods = ((positives + 0.5)/total_positives)
bads = ((negatives + 0.5)/total_negatives)
